[NEWLINE] Hubble constant The procedure that we have outlined can provide just the potential information that we need to convert the measured arrival times to a value of the Hubble constant , subject to the usual concerns associated with the influence of intervening mass distribution and the overall world model . The results can only be as good as the image intensity model and the corrections made to it . It does , however , include one more internal consistency check . The three ratios of the arrival times are determined independently by the potential model and can be compared with the observed values .

...now about 40 observed examples of `` strong '' gravitational lensing , in which multiple images of a background object are produced by the gravitational potential of an intervening object ( ) . Constructing models for the gravitational potential of the deflecting mass in these systems is of fundamental importance , in the first place to verify that the observed system is truly a gravitational lens . A crucial hurdle for every promising gravitational lens candidate is to have its image configuration reproduced , at least approximately , by a plausible model for the deflecting mass distribution . If this can not be achieved , the lensing interpretation must be seriously doubted . [NEWLINE] Once this and other tests for lensing are passed successfully , however , model construction moves beyond a plausibility check into a direct measurement of the mass distribution of the lens . Lensing makes a unique contribution because it is sensitive to all forms of mass ( including dark matter ) , yet does not depend on any luminous tracers in the lens . Lens modeling is also a crucial step in the enterprise of determining cosmological parameters by measuring the time delays between the light curves of multiple images . A successful model will predict the values of these time delays in terms of parameters such as H_0 , _m , an...

[NEWLINE] A measurement of the time delay between the flux variations in corresponding images and the lens redshift z_l , when combined with a model that predicts the dimensionless time delay , thereby amounts to a measurement of the combination of angular diameter distances D_L D_S /D_LS . Since the relation between angular diameter distance and redshift depends on the values of H_0 , _m , an...
