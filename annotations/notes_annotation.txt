Doesn't seem like the best idea to have the annotators subdivide long-form names. Too much detail too quickly.
Perhaps have a second pass of annotation? -> Will probably need a better notion of different forms/syntax (object-property not enough).

How to deal with parameter names inside constraints?
-> Easy to extract, so don't bother.
-> But do need to think about how this interfaces with Name/Measurement relations

Do we want people to annotate *all* parameter names and symbols, even those which do not relate to a measurement?
-> More data?

How do we want to formalise Detail annotations?
Often very useful information, but so many different kinds of information can fall into this category.

For finding papers:
	Select papers with measurement patterns (with either units or uncertainty?) in abstract
	And papers with measurement pattern in section titled Results|Summary|Conclusion

Abstracts aren't going to give us enough data for symbol definitions. How could we narrow this down?
-> Second pass of annotation? Find instances of parameter symbols in the body of paper, and ask if it's a definition

How do we set up this annotation?
-> How did Pontus do it for his biomed stuff?
-> Is mechanical turk set up for this stuff?
Email UCL CS Finance

How much of an issue is the bad line-splitting in the converted text?

Ask Pontus about a new input to a NN based on origin node in XML tree.

Unconfirmed annotation tag? -> Color to indicate







Need a way to annotate a link to an object. As in, "measured virial mass" needs to be linked to "SJ4321" or something.

Alternatively, need a flag to indicate that measurement is related to a specific sample/catalogue.



Object->Object Equivalence annotation
Make it so that a Measurement can be the end point of a Condition
