A new age-redshift test is proposed in order to constrain H _ { 0 } with basis on the existence of old high redshift galaxies ( OHRG ) .
As should be expected , the estimates of H _ { 0 } based on the OHRG are heavily dependent on the cosmological description .
In the flat concordance model ( \Lambda CDM ) , for example , the value of H _ { 0 } depends on the mass density parameter \Omega _ { M } = 1 - \Omega _ { \Lambda } .
Such a degeneracy can be broken trough a joint analysis involving the OHRG and baryon acoustic oscillation ( BAO ) signature .
In the framework of the \Lambda CDM model our joint analysis yields a value of H _ { 0 } = 71 \pm 0.04 { km s } ^ { -1 } Mpc ^ { -1 } ( 1 \sigma ) with the best fit density parameter \Omega _ { M } = 0.27 \pm 0.03 .
Such results are in good agreement with independent studies from the Hubble Space Telescope key project and the recent estimates of WMAP , thereby suggesting that the combination of these two independent phenomena provides an interesting method to constrain the Hubble constant .
