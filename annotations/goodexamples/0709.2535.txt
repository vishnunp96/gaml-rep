We provide preliminary quantitative evidence that a new solution to averaging the observed inhomogeneous structure of matter in the universe ( ) , may lead to an observationally viable cosmology without exotic dark energy .
We find parameters which simultaneously satisfy three independent tests : the match to the angular scale of the sound horizon detected in the cosmic microwave background anisotropy spectrum ; the effective comoving baryon acoustic oscillation scale detected in galaxy clustering statistics ; and type Ia supernova luminosity distances .
Independently of the supernova data , concordance is obtained for a value of the Hubble constant which agrees with the measurement of the Hubble Key team of ( ) .
Best–fit parameters include a global average Hubble constant H _ { \lower 2.0 pt \hbox { $ \scriptstyle 0 $ } } = 61.7 ^ { +1.2 } _ { -1.1 } \hbox { km } \hbox% { sec } ^ { -1 } \hbox { Mpc } ^ { -1 } , a present epoch void volume fraction of { f _ { \hbox { \sevenrm v 0 } } } = 0.76 ^ { +0.12 } _ { -0.09 } , and an age of the universe of 14.7 ^ { +0.7 } _ { -0.5 } billion years as measured by observers in galaxies .
The mass ratio of non–baryonic dark matter to baryonic matter is 3.1 ^ { +2.5 } _ { -2.4 } , computed with a baryon–to–photon ratio that concords with primordial lithium abundances .
